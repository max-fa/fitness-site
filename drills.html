				<h1>Muscle Mechanics</h1>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Quadriceps</h3>
				<p>Constituents: Four muscles: the vastus lateralis,vastus medialis,vastus intermedius,and the rectus femoris.</p>
				<p>Location: Front of the thigh,from the hip bone down to the kneecap.</p>
				<p>Function: Extending the knees and flexing the hips.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Hamstrings</h3>
				<p>Constituents: biceps femoris, semimembranosus,and semitendinosus</p>
				<p>Location: Back of the thigh from the glutes to above and behind the kneecap.</p>
				<p>Function: Bending the knee,extending the hips(in conjunction with the glutes),outer and inner rotation of lower legs.</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Adductors</h3>
				<p>Location: Pelvis down to the femur bone</p>
				<p>Function: Adduction(inwards motion) of the hip(it maintains the space between your legs,not too wide,not too narrow).</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Glutes</h3>
				<p>Location: Where do you think?</p>
				<h5>Function</h5>
				<p>Deceleration,balance,stability in lower body,and shock absorption</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3>Calves</h3>
				<p>Location: Along the back of the lower leg from the bottom of the knee to the ankles</p>
				<p>Function: Flexing & Extending the feet and(it only assists in this function) knee flexion.</p>

				<h1>Warmups & Stretches</h1>
				<hr>
				<section id="stretches-overview">
					<p>First lesson of the day:stretches and warmups are two <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">different</span> things.Warmups are when you increase activity in the target muscle(s) to increase bloodflow,muscle temperature, and heartrate.The increased heat in your muscles loosens them and reduces chances of suffering pulls and tears.Increased bloodflow allow energy to be delivered to your muscles more efficiently.And the increased heartrate leads to other events which lead to waste being cleared from your muscles more efficiently,along with cooling down to prevent overheating via perspiration. </p>				
					<p>Static stretches are when you extend yout muscles leading them to become relaxed and reducing that muscles total amount of power it is able to generate during contractions.This negative effect though only lasts for the short amount of time after stretching before your muscles naturally contract to their pre-stretch length.If stretching regularly though,you can reap the long-term benefits such as naturally increasing your muscle length without neccesarily weakening it(provided you work on strengthening your muscles as well),thus increasing your general level of flexibility which can lead to improved range of motion and decreased chance of suffering muscle tears and pulls(although you should still participate in sufficient warmups before exercise).</p>
